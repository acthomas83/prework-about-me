      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a System Administrator of a Learning Management System for Philips Healthcare.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from St. Louis, MO.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love traveling, photography, fitness, dogs, real estate development and anything technology related.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Ideally, my goal is to become self-employed as both a real estate investor and as an independent contractor offering development services.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Atlanta, GA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Since the age of 9, I was drawn to computers and technology in general. As the years passed, I became very proficient using computers, particularly my Macintosh Performa 635. Before long, I began to wonder how it all works. With that curiosity, I found myself completely disassembling my computer and miraculously putting it all back together with no help at all. YouTube University wasn’t around back then. After many more years of self-educating myself on the basics of Information Technology, I landed my first IT job as a Technical Support Specialist at Philips. With so much exposure to technology and vital company systems, I knew that I needed to expand my technical knowledge through formal education. After reading about the Coding Boot Camp, I knew this would be the opportunity I’ve been waiting for to help me connect the many “technical dots” that I have collected over the years.</p>
